# Code of Conduct
- **Think before you react.** If you disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes before responding.

- **Ask questions, don't make demands.** ("What do you think about trying...?" rather than "Don’t do...!!!")

- **Don't insult.** Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. ("dumb", "stupid"). Assume everyone is attractive, intelligent, and well-meaning.

- **Be explicit.** Remember people don't always understand your intentions online.

- **Don't use hyperbole.** ("always", "never", "endlessly", "nothing")

- **Use emoji to clarify tone.** (":sparkles::sparkles: Looks good :+1: :sparkles::sparkles:" rather than "Looks good.")

# Issues
## Before writing an Issue

[**Watch this tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJlYiMp8FuY) if you have never used GitHub's Issue tracker before. It only takes 3 minutes!

[![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TJlYiMp8FuY/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJlYiMp8FuY)

#### Always search your Issue before opening a new one. Creating duplicates is slower for everyone!

## Writing an Issue
### The Title

- #### Others should be able to guess what the Issue is about by reading its title.

- Try to use less than 40 characters.

- **Avoid writing `Wurst`** in the title. It is obvious that your Issue is about Wurst.

- If the title gets too long, remove words like `the` and `a`.

- **Don't put a dot at the end.** It's a headline, not a sentence.

#### Examples:

- "".help 1" command throwing NullPointerException" :white_check_mark: **good title**

- "WUrst bug FIX UP!!1 (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻" :x: **bad title**

### The Body

- #### Don't include opinions or judgements, only information.
  - "I found a bug." :white_check_mark: **good**
  - "I love/hate Wurst and found a bug." :x: **bad**

- **Use proper grammar & Markdown.** If no one can read it, no one can help you.  
If you have never used markdown before, you can [learn it in 3 minutes](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

- **Don't put multiple Issues into one issue.** That makes them impossible organize and will likely get your issue ignored or removed.

- **Be clear**
 - **about problems:** What was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can reproduce the problem;
 - **about suggestions:** What will your feature do, how will it help, why is it useful?

- **Include screenshots** if your Issue is about something visible. Embed the screenshots directly into your Issue, don't link to external images.

- **Include system details** like the Java version and operating system you’re using.

- **Paste error output** like Java stacktraces or Minecraft launcher logs into your Issue. Wrap it into a Markdown code block, like this:

<pre>```
java.lang.NullPointerException: null
  at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.AppenderControl.callAppender(AppenderControl.java:89)
	at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.LoggerConfig.callAppenders(LoggerConfig.java:425)
	at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.LoggerConfig.log(LoggerConfig.java:406)
	at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.LoggerConfig.log(LoggerConfig.java:367)
	at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.Logger.log(Logger.java:110)
```</pre>

#### Always include stacktraces or crash logs when reporting errors or crashes.

If it's too long to paste it into the Issue, paste it into a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

#### Examples:

> :white_check_mark: **good Issue**

## After writing an Issue

- **Respond to questions**, especially if you get the `more info required` label.

- **Don't get angry** or needy if your Issue gets rejected. We are free to reject any Issue for any reason.

# Pull Requests
> **Note:** There haven't been many Pull Requests yet, so these guidelines are mostly based on predictions rather than experience.

- [**Read the tutorial**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) if you have never forked a repository before.  
[![](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/bootcamp/Bootcamp-Fork.png)](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

- **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.

- **Pull in changes** from the original often so that you stay up to date. That way, when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.

- **Create a branch** for your edits.

- **Be clear** about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your feature will help. Then be equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.

- **It’s best to test.** Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.

- **Include screenshots** of the before and after if your changes include visible differences. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.

- **Keep the style** of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.

# Commits

- Use present tense & imperative mood.
  - "Add feature" :white_check_mark: **good**
  - "Added feature" :x: **bad**
  - "Adds feature" :x: **bad**
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - :bug: `:bug:` when fixing bugs

  - :bar_chart: `:bar_chart:` when dealing with Google Analytics
  - :art: `:art:` when designing GUIs etc.
  - :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
